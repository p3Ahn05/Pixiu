                The Sichuan province of China is infamous for their spicy cuisine, and one of the ingredients that serves as the essence to many of these dishes: chili oil. An oil infused with flavor and heat with a versatility that is only limited by your imagination. You can apply it in traditional Chinese recipes like dan dan noodles, mapo tofu, and cucumber salad. You can use it to saute vegetables, cook eggs, or simply as a dipping sauce. Pixiu Chili Oil is a simple, yet delicious take on this universal seasoning, taking form after many trials and many taste tests. Inspired by the nostalgic flavors of my upbringing, I developed this product in hopes of sharing my culture and helping the community.

<h1> Our Mission </h1>

           <td style="font-size:20px">
             A Zhua Zhou is a celebration during a childs one year birthday where an array of items are layed out, the one they pick symbolizes their future. At my Zhua Zhou, I ignored the items completely, reaching to grab the spread of food that lay next to them. Though this could have easily meant I was just a hungry kid, luckily it extended further; by the age of two I was cutting mushrooms with a chef's knife the size of my torso, and today I continue to explore this passion, pushing my abilities whenever I find time. My hope in embarking on this project is to share my passion--or the ability to explore it--with others.
